## Context — Genesis v2 Project
This work is part of **Genesis v2**: a privacy-first, audit-ready memory framework for AI.
Genesis v2 defines four cooperating layers:

- **L — Language (GMQL):** a declarative memory query language (“SQL for memory”).  
- **E — Engine (LifeDB):** the execution kernel that stores, indexes, and retrieves signals.  
- **R — Rosetta:** consent, privacy, and policy enforcement (GDPR/AI Act hooks).  
- **D — Drivers:** connectors for SQL/NoSQL/vector stores and external systems.

**GGA** (Genesis General Algebra) and **GAA** (Genesis Agent Algebra) are the algebraic
components that formalize operations over these layers. GGA is the general calculus;
GAA specializes it for AI agents.
